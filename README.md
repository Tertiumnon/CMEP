#C_M_E P (component_module_element property) style guide for web

CME is a ideology of creating names for web (blocks, classes etc).

Typical name is a name of component, name of module and name of element.

Example:

 id="we_search_address"
where "we" (abbreviation "wysiwig-editor") - component, "search" - module, "address" - element

 class="we_search_address show"
where element "address" has property "show"
